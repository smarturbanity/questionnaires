The **PlanEasy Crowdsourcing Framework** is a core component of the **PlanEasy WebGIS ecosystem**,  
a research and development environment for participatory mapping, mobility analysis, and citizen science.

This repository defines the **data architecture**, **privacy model**, and **FAIR-compliant standards**  
used across PlanEasy-based research projects - providing a transparent and interoperable foundation  
for collecting, managing, and sharing crowdsourced information.

> 🧩 This framework does **not** include source code or operational databases.  
> It provides **open documentation and data schemas** to ensure transparency, GDPR compliance, and reproducibility.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The **PlanEasy Crowdsourcing Framework** provides a standardized workflow for research teams, public bodies,  
and organizations wishing to collect participatory data in a compliant and reproducible way.

1. **Prepare your questionnaire**  
   - Use the **PlanEasy Questionnaire Builder** to design your survey.  
   - Follow the structure of existing schemas (see the [PlanEasy Questionnaires Folder](questionnaires/README.md)).  
   - Export your questionnaire as a JSON file including version and metadata.

2. **Configure your database**  
   - Your team creates and manages its own **Firestore** **or** **MongoDB** instance.  
   - The schema **must** follow [`docs/DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md).  
   - PlanEasy provides configuration guidance and validation tools to ensure compatibility.  
   - All responses are stored **in pseudonymized form**, aligned with GDPR and FAIR standards.

3. **Distribute your survey link**  
   - PlanEasy provides a **dedicated web or mobile URL** for each questionnaire.  
   - The link targets your database index via query parameters — **PlanEasy does not store your project’s data**.  
   - Participants use this interface; responses are written **directly to your database**.

4. **Access and analyze your data**  
   - Data can be queried directly from Firestore or exported to your research database (e.g. MongoDB).  
   - All timestamps, versions, and identifiers are traceable for reproducibility and open data publication.

> The goal is to make participatory research **modular, ethical, and ready-to-use**,  
> without requiring custom backend development.

## 🌍 Purpose

The PlanEasy Crowdsourcing Framework aims to:
- Provide a **common structure** for participatory and survey-based data collection.  
- Ensure **privacy-by-design** and GDPR compliance in all projects.  
- Support **Open Science** through transparent, version-controlled documentation.  
- Facilitate interoperability between web, mobile, and GIS systems.

## 🔐 Privacy and Ethics

All projects based on the PlanEasy Crowdsourcing Framework must:
- Follow the **GDPR (Article 89)** framework for scientific research.  
- Apply **pseudonymization** and **data separation** to protect personal information.  
- Share only **anonymized and/or aggregated datasets** for scientific and civic purposes.

## 🧩 Interoperability and FAIR Principles

The PlanEasy Crowdsourcing Framework follows the **FAIR Data Principles**:

| Principle | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Findable** | Each dataset and questionnaire has a unique ID and version for traceability. |
| **Accessible** | Documentation and schemas are publicly available under open licenses. |
| **Interoperable** | JSON-based structure compatible with NoSQL and document databases. |
| **Reusable** | Standardized metadata enable reproducibility across research contexts. |
